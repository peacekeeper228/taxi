## How to launch
### Second
main.py implements third method (pipes) of second task (8 queens)
To launch - just run file, no need to change anything, in pipes the first module sends data every 5 seconds 10 times, after it it stops. All other modules works in a moment data arrives at pipe port
### First
main1.py implements second method (shared data) of first task (KWIC)
To launch with different params change it in input function
## Some notes
Here different programs are replaced with functions because of small program size:)
