a) in which case it is easier to change the implementation algorithm in each of the modules? 

###Method 3. Pipes-and-filters
Pipes-and-Filters: Since each filter is a self-contained module, the internal algorithm of a filter can be changed without impacting other modules.
b) in which solution it is easier (= seemingly less effort) to change data representation  

c) in which solution it is easier to add additional functions to the modules

d) which solution is seemingly more performant?

e) if you are asked to implement a similar program, which of the solutions would you reuse?
